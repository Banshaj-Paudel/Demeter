# Demeter
## A forest monitoring system

Demeter is a forest monitoring system that uses a combination of computer audio and machine learning to detect and classify forest fires. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a Circuit Playground Express, but can also be used with a device that can input sound.

## Technologies Used
- Circuit Playground Express
- Arduino IDE
- p5.js
- Google Teachable Machine
- Machine Learning

## Usage
1. Place the Circuit Playground Express in the forest
2. Wait for the Circuit Playground Express to detect a sound
3. The JS code will then send the audio to the Teachable Machine
4. The Teachable Machine will then classify the audio as a forest fire or not
5. The JS code will then send the result to the Arduino
6. The Arduino will then flash the LED on the Circuit Playground Express
